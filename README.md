# Movie-Rating-Prediction
## Overview
This project provides a detailed exploration and machine learning application on the datasets provided. By analyzing user demographics and their movie ratings, we aim to understand the underlying patterns and build predictive models. The goal is to predict movie ratings based on user attributes and movie information using various machine learning algorithms.
## Introduction
It  is widely used for movie recommendation systems and contains data on movies, users, and their ratings. This project performs an in-depth analysis of this dataset and implements multiple machine learning models to predict movie ratings based on various features.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of three CSV files:

#### movies.csv:
* Contains movie IDs, names, and genres.
#### ratings.csv:
* Contains user ratings for movies.
#### users.csv:
* Contains user information such as age, gender, occupation, and zip code.
## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) includes:

* Visualization of user age distribution.
* Analysis of user ratings.
* Visualization of the viewership of movies by age group.
* Identification of top movies by viewership rating.

## Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models are evaluated:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Perceptron
* Linear SVC
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

## Results
The performance of each model is summarized as follows:

* Model	Accuracy (%)
